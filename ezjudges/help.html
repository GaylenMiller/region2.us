                <h4>EZ Judges has four steps for startup</h4>
                <p>These steps are presented together on the &ldquo;Easy Steps&rdquo; tab 
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="step">1</span>Clear All</li>
                    <li><span class="step">2</span>Import Tournament</li>
                    <li><span class="step">3</span>Check Patterns</li>
                    <li><span class="step">4</span>Check Rounds</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The &ldquo;Clear All&rdquo; deletes the judges and debate teams for any prior tournaments</p>
                <p>The &ldquo;Import Tournament&rdquo; imports the registered judges, the parents, the round times and the room counts. The import file comes from the NCFCA Leader Dashboard for the tournament. Go to the &ldquo;Reports&rdquo; screen and download the &ldquo;Judge Tracking 2014&rdquo; file.</p>
                <p>Note: The import step does not automatically &ldquo;Clear&rdquo; because this allows the judges to get imported again during the tournament to get any judges registered after the last import.</p>
                <p>The &ldquo;Check Patterns&rdquo; step is to complete with five checks.<p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span class="step">1</span>Tournament Name</li>
                        <li><span class="step">2</span>Debate Elim Rounds and Rooms</li>
                        <li><span class="step">3</span>Debate Judge Count</li>
                        <li><span class="step">4</span>Speech Patterns A and B Events</li>
                        <li><span class="step">5</span>Speech Judge Count</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Normally all the tournament information comes in correctly and the only work is on check #4 to drag and drog the speech events to the correct pattern.</p>
                <p>The &ldquo;Check Rounds&rdquo; is to verify the round dates and times. If a round included or excluded incorrectly, drag and drop it to the correct location.

                <h3>What is the purpose of the &ldquo;Easy Tasks&rdquo; tab?</h3>

            <div class="answer">
                <h4>It is presenting the options needed for a point in time</h4>
                <p>The tournament is broken into &ldquo;Points In Time&rdquo; based on the events and the rounds. Every debate round has a before and after point in time and each speech round has a before and after point in time. There is also a &ldquo;Before Tournament&rdquo; and &ldquo;After Tournament&rdquo; point in time.</p>
                <p>Based on the current time, the appropriate &ldquo;Point In Time&rdquo; is shown. Move forward or backwards in time with either the slider or the left/right arrows. Click the circular green arrow to return the present.</p>

                <h3>What are some common problems?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <h4>A new judge was entered but EZ Judges is showing is a blank line in the room</h4>
                <p>This is a bug that refuses to show itself to the programmer and still exists. Normally new judges show up fine when testing the software, but in production they can sometimes become invisible. The work around is to exit EZ Judges and start it again.</p>
                <p>If this bug in encountered, please send in feedback via the feedback option on the bottom right side of the screen</p>
                <h4>The database opening in read only mode</h4>
                <p>This can happen when EZ Judges is already open on your computer or, if the database file is shared, open on another computer.</p>
                <h4>The debate team name is incorrect</h4>
                <p>Update the team name in C-Tap Debate. The name in EZ Judges will be updated with the next debate file import.</p>
                <h4>A judge team name is incorrect</h4>
                <p>The &rdquo;Judges&ldquo; tab allows judge name updates. The judges are listed in alphabetical order. Click in the cell, to update the name and then click on another row to save the change.</p>
                <h4>Debate round was imported twice with different room assignments</h4>
                <p>The debate import adds to the existing information. If a debate round was imported, then the rooms changed in C-Tap debate and then imported again, the two sets will be merged in EZ Judges. This can be corrected by dropping the round in EZ Judges and importing the debate round again. The &rdquo;Drop Debate Round&ldquo; can be done either on the &rdquo;Easy Tasks&ldquo; tab, which allows the dropping of either the LD or the TP round, or on the &rdquo;Rooms&ldquo; tab, which will drop both events from the debate round selected in the drop down.</p>

        <div class="question-answer-container">
            <div class="question">
                <h3>Are there any additional features?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <h4>Judges Activity Report</h4>
                <p>The &ldquo;Judges&rdquo; tab includes the &ldquo;Judges Activity Report&rdquo; which shows the events and rounds judged by the currently selected judge in the list of judges.</p>
                <h4>Top Judges Report</h4>
                <p>The &ldquo;Judges&rdquo; tab includes the &ldquo;Top Judges Report&rdquo; which lists the judges by the number of events judged.</p>
                <h4>Judges Thank You Export</h4>
                <p>The &ldquo;Judges&rdquo; tab includes the &ldquo;Judge Thank You Export&rdquo; which will exports to Excel all the Judges that judged an event. The goal is to thank the judges that showed up and judged and leave out the ones that signed up but did not judge.</p>
                <h4>Tournament Graphic Update</h4>
                <p>The &ldquo;Reference &ndash; Tournamet Graphic&rdquo; tab allows a new tournament graphic to be loaded from a file.Use a graphic that is twice as long as it is high and is a Windows bitmap format (.bmp).</p>
                <h4>Judge Count Additional Options</h4>
                <p>The &ldquo;Reference &ndash; Choice Lists&rdquo; tab allows a new Debate or Speech Judge Count to be entered. Click on the desired judge count entry in the top half of the screen to show the existing entries in the bottom half of the screen. Click on the last entry and error down to get a blank row. Fill in the code, descripion and the order it should appear in the drop down list. After entry, click on the previous row to save the change and then restart EZ Judges to see the new entry in the drop down list on the Patterns tab.</p>
                <p>For example, a new code might be &rdquo;1337&ldquo;, meaning 1 judge for prelims, 3 for quarter finals, 3 for semi-finals and 7 for finals.</p>
